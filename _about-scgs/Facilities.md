Enter into the unique world of Singapore Chinese Girls’ School. Experience this special place and relish the rich and glorious heritage of all of its 121 years – be charmed by the vibrant floral-motif Peranakan tiles, the inviting swings, a Peranakan Spice Garden and be inspired by the majestic blocks named after our founding fathers.

Seated at the prime location of [190 Dunearn Road](https://www.google.com/maps/search/190+Dunearn+Road?entry=gmail&source=g), this esteemed institution is well-linked to the Stevens MRT, it is just minutes away from Orchard Road.

Home to our students, our _kim geks_ (‘gold’ and ‘jade’ in Hokkien), we welcome you to this precious space – replete with its refurbished facilities to provide a safe, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing experience!
