<h1><strong>Good Stories</strong></h1>
<h2>NCC ICEP - Hong Kong</h2>
<p><strong><u>Ashley Grace Chong, Sec 3GR (2023)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>I was selected to participate in the International Cadet Exchange Programme
(ICEP) with NCC Headquarters, as part of the 10-cadet contingent that visited
and learnt from the Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps.</p>
<p>This experience broadened my perspective of Hong Kong's maritime defence
installations. I even had a hands-on session at the Marine Police Headquaters
and the fire department to better understand the complexity of maritime
defence infrastructure, as well as the importance of protecting the city
from potential threats. I also gained an appreciation for the city's vibrant
culture and rich historical heritage.</p>
<p>Having to work with cadets from different schools was a valuable experience
that helped me gain a better understanding of the dynamics of different
personalities and how to communicate effectively. I developed better problem-solving
skills and am even more confident in conversing with others. This once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity has also allowed me to build relationships and friendships
that last a lifetime.</p>
