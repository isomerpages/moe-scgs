<h1><strong>Achievements (Secondary)</strong></h1>
<h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
<p>1. Our heartiest congratulations to the 2023 Secondary 4 cohort for their
excellent performance in the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations!</p>
<p>2. The Class of 2023 exemplified adaptability and resilience in the face
of an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, which first struck early in their
secondary education four years ago. Together with their teachers, this
cohort of Kim Geks adapted quickly to new ways of learning as well as connecting
and collaborating with one another through online modes. They exercised
independence and perseverance to continue their journey of growth with
positivity amidst changes due to safe management measures. In the process,
they also showed care and kindness to one another. Over the years, the
cohort seized opportunities to enjoy school life fully through experiences
such as Sports Festival, SC Rave and self-initiated interclass games facilitated
by student leaders. With their resolute and courageous spirit, we believe
the class of 2023 will be in good stead as they move on to the next phase
of their educational journey.</p>
<p>3. We would like to express our special appreciation to everyone who has
guided our Kim Geks. Our team of dedicated and committed teaching and non-teaching
staff have guided and supported them with much care and love. We also deeply
appreciate the unwavering partnership of our parents, Board of Directors
and Alumni in supporting and nurturing them throughout this milestone journey.</p>
