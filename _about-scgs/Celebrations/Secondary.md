<p>Under the guidance and care of their teachers, the Class of 2024 exemplified
adaptability, determination and enthusiasm. In the SC125 Celebrations,
they played an instrumental role in rallying the school to contribute,
ensuring the success of the various events and leaving a lasting impression
on the school and community partners. Their leadership and dedication underscored
their outstanding ability to inspire and further strengthen the school
spirit. While&nbsp;juggling various roles and responsibilities, they persevered
with a strong sense of purpose and an unwavering will to achieve their
goals, whether personal or collective. This steadfast determination reflects
their commitment to growth and their aspiration to make a meaningful impact
on those around them. We are confident that the Class of 2024 is well-prepared
to thrive in the next phase of their educational journey.</p>
