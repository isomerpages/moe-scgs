# **Our Beliefs**

### Our Philosophy

The SCGS education philosophy stems from our strong belief in providing a holistic and balanced education founded on a bedrock of timeless values and rich heritage. We add richness and active engagement to the learning experience. Our environment offers the warmth and support of a caring family. We nurture every student to grow her interests and aptitude, to achieve her personal best. Each child is different, and the treasures uncovered will be as unique as individual pieces of gold and jade.

Notwithstanding the unique talents of each child, our desire is for every SCGS girl to develop the qualities of a _Kim Gek_ (gold and jade in _Hokkien_).

The _Kim Gek is a_ young lady who is the pride of her family because she embodies the virtues of filial piety, kindness, propriety and diligence. She has the strength and inner beauty of jade, as well as the flexibility and purity of gold to adapt and thrive in life.

The _Kim Gek_ in the 21st century is a capable woman of character and relevance who is ready for the challenges of a rapidly evolving world. She is a:

**Sincere Collaborator** who communicates confidently and works well with people across cultural contexts;

**Courageous Change Maker** who is visionary, innovative, and possesses grit;  

**Generous Contributor** who uses her talents and skills to benefit the community, and stays relevant through continual learning;

**Servant Leader** who is anchored in values and has a heart for those she serves.
