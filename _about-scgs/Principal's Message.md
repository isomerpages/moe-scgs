Developing capable women of character and relevance. This has been the endeavour of Singapore Chinese Girls’ School since its establishment in 1899.

Today, we continue to provide a rich, balanced and holistic education so that every student is developed to her fullest potential, and has the values and competencies to contribute meaningfully to the community in a rapidly evolving world. We nurture each girl to be a ‘Kim Gek’ (or gold and jade in Hokkien) – a precious gem with the purity and flexibility of gold as well as the beauty and toughness of jade. It is our hope that our girls will live out the school values of Sincerity, Courage, Generosity and Service, both during their time with us and when they move on to greater challenges and roles in life.

Being a full school, we have the privilege of seeing our girls grow from age 6 to 16. At Secondary 1, we welcome a significant intake of students from other primary schools into the SCGS Secondary Division which offers both the Integrated Programme and the O-Level Programme.

We invite you to peruse our website to get a glimpse of the varied learning experiences that our girls enjoy, from rigorous and engaging academic curriculum, the rich co-curricular programmes that develop character, leadership and life skills, to the myriad enrichment programmes that help our girls discover their talents and interests and stretch their potential.

These learning experiences are only possible with the unstinting efforts of our caring staff and the strong support of the SCGS Board, our parents, alumni and partners. Together, we continue our strong tradition of excellent holistic education that grooms our students to be women of character and relevance.
