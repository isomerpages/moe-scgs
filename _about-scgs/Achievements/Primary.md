### Summary of 2021 PSLE Results

This has been an unprecedented year and our _kim geks_ made us proud by presenting their grit and resilience in this year’s Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).  We are pleased to share that our Primary 6 cohort of 2021 has performed well in their Primary School Leaving Examinations.  All qualified for secondary education with more than 90% of our students eligible for the Express Stream. We congratulate our _kim geks_ and their parents for the excellent results!
