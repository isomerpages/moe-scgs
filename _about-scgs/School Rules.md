<h1><strong>School Rules</strong></h1>
<p>In tandem with the Ministry of Education’s 21st Century Competencies and
Character and Citizenship Education outcomes, the school aims to support
the development of self-discipline and good character in our students and
equip them with the necessary social and emotional skills to be responsible
and respectful individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is our desire to develop strong moral fibre and integrity in all our <em>Kim Geks</em>.
The school rules dovetail our discipline philosophy to shape the character
of our <em>Kim Geks</em> in a caring and enabling environment. They form
part of the school’s character and leadership development, that aims to
develop the following in our students:</p>
<p>(i) self-awareness and self-management for personal well-being, growth
and maturity,&nbsp;
<br>(ii) social awareness and manage relationships for one’s social well-being,
and&nbsp;
<br>(iii) ability to make informed choices and responsible decisions so as
to contribute positively to the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
