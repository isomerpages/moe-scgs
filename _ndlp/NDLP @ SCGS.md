# **NDLP @ SCGS**

### Overview 

**At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.** 

A key thrust of the programme is to equip all secondary students with a **personal learning device (PLD).** 

### Learning with a PLD @ SCGS

At SCGS, our Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) inform the development of NDLP vision and the outcomes of our kim geks. in getting them future-ready.

**Guidelines for Acceptable Use of Personal Learning Device (PLD) at SCGS**

Learning with a Personal Learning Device (PLD) is a privilege. The guidelines, crafted with input and feedback from our _kim geks_ and staff, stem from our desire to see our _kim geks_ use their PLDs in balanced and healthy ways, embracing the joy of learning as we harness technology for learning. 

Even as the PLDs extend and enrich our learning, these guidelines outline the responsible practices in using them in our SCGS community.  They may also apply to other devices considered by the school to fall under these guidelines. To facilitate the use of PLDs during lessons, teachers may also set routines and requirements in their lessons.

There are four sections in the Guidelines: 

1.  Responsible Care of your PLD
2.  Cyber Security
3.  Cyber Wellness
4.  Discipline Guidelines Concerning PLDs

As part of the NDLP, we will be encouraging our _kim geks_ to follow this set of guidelines on the safe and responsible practices of PLD use, to support daily teaching and learning in school.
