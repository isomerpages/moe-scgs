# **NDLP @ SCGS**

### Overview 

**At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.** 

A key thrust of the programme is to equip all secondary students with a **personal learning device (PLD).** 

### Learning with a PLD @ SCGS

At SCGS, our Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) inform the development of NDLP vision and the outcomes of our kim geks. in getting them future-ready.
