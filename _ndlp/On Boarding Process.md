Together with the device, your child will be provided with the following two accounts:

1. Student iCON, your child will receive an MOE-issued email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of the Google Suite. With the student iCON, your child will have access to the G Suite services including storage in Google Drive, access to Microsoft ProPlus as well as Zoom.
2. Apple ID, the school will issue your child with an Apple ID managed by the school. This will come with 200GB of iCloud storage

### Use of Edusave

Singapore Citizen students can use Edusave for the purchase of the PLD.

To ensure the affordability of PLDs, MOE&nbsp;

*   has provided an&nbsp;**Edusave top-up &nbsp;of $200 in 2020,**&nbsp;and&nbsp;
*   has provided another&nbsp;**Edusave top-up of $200 in May 2021**&nbsp;(as part of the Household Support Package announced in Budget 2021)

to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the&nbsp;**annual $290**&nbsp;credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.

### Financial Assistance

Students currently on MOE financial assistance schemes will also receive subsidy for the PLD purchase. The school will confirm again with students should they need to reapply for financial&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;More information will be shared by the school at a later date.
