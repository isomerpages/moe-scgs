<h3>Use of Edusave</h3>
<p>Singapore Citizen students can use Edusave for the purchase of the PLD.</p>
<p>To ensure the affordability of PLDs, MOE has provided <strong>Edusave top-ups of $200</strong> from
2020 to 2022, and <strong>$300</strong> in 2023 to all eligible Singaporean
students in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>This is on top of the <strong>annual $290</strong> credited into the Edusave
account for Secondary School students.</p>
<h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
<p>Students currently on MOE financial assistance schemes will also receive
subsidies for the PLD purchase. The school will confirm again with students
should they need to reapply for financial assistance. More information
will be shared by the school at a later date.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>The timeline for 2025 Sec One students and returning Singaporeans will
be shared in January 2025.</p>
