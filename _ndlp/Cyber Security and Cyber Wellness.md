# **Cyber Security and Cyber Wellness**

The school will ensure a safe learning experience for the students when they use the devices. We will also guide students on the correct habit of usage and restrict the access to certain sites. Some measures that we will put in place include the following two key areas of Device Management Application and Cyber Wellness Education.

**Device Management Application**

The Device Management Application (DMA) is a software which allows schools to manage students’ usage of tablets or laptops used for learning. The Device Management Application (DMA) software will be installed  on all students’ devices to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and to prevent misuse of the device.

*   Installation of the DMA will be performed after the collection of the device. Students will be guided on the installation
*   This applies to both devices purchased through the school and pre-existing student-owned devices

The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber wellness. The DMA can:

*   Remotely deploy teaching and learning applications as well as security patches
*   Enable teachers to monitor and control the students’ screens
*   Restrict apps and websites accessible
*   Manage screen time

With a DMA, our students can be better supported in their use of technology to enhance their learning in a safe and effective digital learning environment, both in school and at home. 

While the DMA helps manage students’ use of PLDs and promotes cyber wellness, schools and parents need to continue working together in teaching our students’ good digital habits and develop self-regulation skills to ensure devices are used safely and responsibly both during school and after- school hours.

### **Cyber Wellness Education** 

In SCGS, we believe in the holistic development of a child. We nurture students of character and relevance through the provision of opportunities to inculcate values, skills and competencies in our students.

The Cyber Wellness lessons in CCE focus on the positive physical and psychological well-being of students as they navigate the cyber world. It involves the understanding of the norms of responsible behaviour regarding technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other users in the cyber world.
