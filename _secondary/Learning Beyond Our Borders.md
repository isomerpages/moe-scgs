# **Learning Beyond Our Borders**

In a global world, the ability to adapt to diverse cultures, communicate across boundaries and work in international settings become paramount. Our Internationalisation Programme provides authentic learning opportunities, so students can appreciate cultural, economic and social diversity. They conduct pre-trip research, interact and bond with people of different cultures, and undergo a process of reflection and evaluation when completing their trip. We have multiple programmes that allow our students to learn beyond our borders. These opportunities see SCGS partner many established institutions and industry leaders to develop our students to be world-ready leaders.  Below are some of the trips made in the last few years.
