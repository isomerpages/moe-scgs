# **Passion Pursuit**

### _Passion to Pursue Hopes and Dreams_

It’s the journey that counts, not the destination. Our students are able to experience the joy of pursuing their passion through various opportunities.  It is through passionate exploration that they find their purpose and meaning for life’s journey, and discover their enduring hopes and dreams.

**Passion Pursuit** provides avenues for high academic achievement, intellectual discovery, leadership excellence and extra-curricular exploration essential to lifelong learning.
