# **Passion Pursuit**

_Guided by the firm belief that the joy of learning is integral to supporting future learning and igniting a zest for life, our Passion Pursuit (PP) programme offers customised opportunities for JIP students to pursue their learning at an extended or deeper level in both the academic and non-academic domains during their six-year journey with the JIP._

<font color="#1E395F">**Passion Pursuit**</font> provides avenues for intellectual discovery, leadership excellence and extra-curricular exploration essential to lifelong learning, through an enriching journey of _Diverge_, _Converge_ and _Emerge_. Students get to explore a broad spectrum of interest areas under the _Diverge_ phase, understand what passion really means through the _Converge_ phase and eventually actualise it as part of purposeful living in the _Emerge_ phase. Our flagship programme will inspire our students to not simply discover their passions, but aspire to use that to positively impact others for the betterment of society.

<font color="#1E395F">**Passion Pursuit**</font> is implemented through _Platforms for Exploration_ and _Platforms for Pursuit_, and is further enriched by the strong partnership among the JIP schools and our networks of alumni and community partners.
