# **Overview**

Over generations, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School have developed many leaders across extensive fields whose significant contributions have transformed our society. We continue this legacy of excellence together with Eunoia Junior College, through the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP).

The JIP is not merely a programme but a community anchored by a strong culture of care for every student.&nbsp; With more than 250 years of experience in education between the four schools, as well as extensive alumni networks spanning diverse fields, the JIP is well-poised to provide an enriching and relevant curriculum that stretches students’ potential with customised learning opportunities and equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to be future-ready, as Principled Leaders of Tomorrow.

### The JIP Approach and the JIP Graduate

##### <u>The JIP Approach</u>

The JIP approach for developing and nurturing Principled Leaders of Tomorrow consists of the three key pillars of **(1) character development**, **(2)&nbsp;cognitive development** and **(3) leadership development**. The outer portion of the diagram shows the knowledge, skills and attitudes that are embodied by our graduates.

This approach is helmed by our team of dedicated and highly qualified professionals who ensure that students learn in a vibrant environment with state-of-the-art facilities. Unique to the JIP, our flagship _World Readiness Programme_ and _Passion Pursuit_ challenges students to examine world issues, consider multiple perspectives, seek opportunities beyond problems and embrace possibilities beyond risks. By providing a variety of learning experiences, including exciting collaborations with the larger community, students are empowered to find and hone diverse talents alongside like-minded peers. Voices are nurtured, self-confidence raised and curiosity piqued such that students are empowered to discover their passion for life and inspired them to make learning a lifelong endeavour.

##### <u>The JIP Graduate</u>

The JIP graduate is a Principled Leader of Tomorrow who possesses strength of character, a heart for service, with the wisdom and courage to chart tomorrow as leaders of their generation. They are discerning individuals who challenge themselves to think critically and make sound moral and ethical judgements. As persons of integrity with a passion for life, they also demonstrate high levels of distinction in their acquisition and mastery of 21st Century Competencies and dedicate their talents to impact lives in positive and ethical ways.

### The JIP Curriculum

In the JIP, students immerse themselves in an enriching, extensive and authentic six-year learning experience that effectively equips them to explore and further develop their personal strengths, passions and talents.
JIP students from Catholic High School (CHS), CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS) will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to EJC and can look forward to the following Ministry of Education (MOE) special programmes that are tailor-made to cater to their learning passions and aspirations.  From Year 3, JIP students can offer the Bicultural Studies Programme, which is also offered in EJC. 

### World Readiness Programme 

_Beyond the Core Academic Programme, our unique World Readiness Programme (WRP) aims to develop our students’ ability to impact lives in positive, ethical and meaningful ways. The WRP prepares our students for the world by elevating them beyond the classroom and equipping them to understand Singapore’s role in the international arena. This programme will also give them exposure to both Eastern and Western perspectives of geopolitical, social, cultural, economic and technological issues and megatrends to give our students the edge as they step up onto the global stage._

##### <u>Curriculum</u>

From Years 1 to 4, modules offered under Philosophy of Knowledge and Emerging Asia ride on the existing strengths of our schools in nurturing bilingual and bicultural students. They also develop our JIP students to be well-versed in eastern and western perspectives on knowledge, reason and values. In turn, the Current Affairs modules are designed to promote an understanding of global issues and megatrends.
From Years 1 to 4, the knowledge that our JIP students acquire in WRP will provide them with the foundational knowledge and skills that will put them in good stead for specific subjects and special programmes offered at EJC.

The WRP utilises a variety of learning platforms to engage students. In addition to lectures and tutorials in each school schools also engage or participate in programmes organized by external agencies (e.g. participation in Model United Nations Conferences).&nbsp; The three partner secondary schools also collaboratively organise annual **WRP Symposiums** where students are brought together to benefit from the synergistic sharing of ideas and perspectives.&nbsp; At these WRP Symposiums, our students interact with people across a broad spectrum of society, including research engineers, foreign diplomats, social entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

Students who are applying to the Joint Integrated Programme may wish to note that they will spend their first four years in SCGS before progressing to&nbsp;[Eunoia Junior College](http://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/)&nbsp; to complete their six-year IP course.&nbsp;The JC will also admit O-Level applicants through the Joint Admission Exercise leading to the&nbsp;[GCE A-Level Examinations](https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/2021-results/).
