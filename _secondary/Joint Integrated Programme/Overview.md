# **Overview**

### Principled Leaders of Tomorrow

The Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) offers an exceptional blend of excellence in character, cognitive and leadership development. Offered in partnership with Catholic High School, CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School and Eunoia Junior College, the JIP is focused on cultivating intellectual resilience and ethical leadership while facilitating the pursuit of possibilities.

Our vibrant and collaborative learning community prepares students to meet challenges and inspires them to be Principled Leaders of Tomorrow.

Students are given a priceless head start through a cutting edge platform emphasising key components which spur critical and creative thinking, and impart a strong sense of integrity.

Our holistic JIP Curriculum comprises four key components:

*   Core Academic Programme

*   World Readiness Programme

*   Character Leadership Excellence Programme

*   Passion Pursuit

We offer an enriching, authentic and values-based learning experience that prepares students for the globalised world. The thoughtfully planned and invigorating learning curriculum opens up avenues for self-directed learning in the pursuit of interests and in the nurturing of talents.

We leverage on technologies to enable borderless learning and engender creative learning spaces, so world readiness becomes a reality for our students, not just a vision.

Our teachers are curriculum leaders who are solidly grounded in current trends and research while possessing a good grasp of future challenges. They are trail blazing, dynamic and experienced professionals, who mould young minds and hearts with great care.
