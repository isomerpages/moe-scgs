### Philosophy:

The SCGS Home Economics Programme aims to develop students’ knowledge and attitudes in Home Economics for the well-being of self, family and the community.  We believe that such life-skills are an important aspect of a holistic education.

## Programme:

Home Economics is taught at the Lower Secondary levels with emphasis on both theory and practical aspects of the subject. Students are taught the basic principles of nutrition, food management and food science for healthy and modern living as well as strategies to make informed choices as a consumer. Our programme also  includes basic needlework craft and lessons on personal grooming and hygiene which are useful life-skills.  Opportunities are given to students to enjoy hands on experiences at culinary art, to adopt technology and innovation in food science and to express creativity through needlework craft.
