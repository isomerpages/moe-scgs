<p>Mathematics, the language of nature, is a versatile tool that transcends
different aspects of everyday life. Present in the environment around us,
and employed in the study of various subjects such as economics, science
and engineering, the learning of Mathematics involves an understanding
of logical thinking and general problem solving strategies. It involves
observing and investigating patterns and relationships in social and physical
phenomena.</p>

<h3>Programme:</h3>
<p>SCGS values Mathematics as not only an essential academic subject, but
also an important vehicle through which the mind can be stretched, and
critical and creative reasoning skills honed.&nbsp; Through the SCGS Mathematics
programme, students will develop habits of thinking in this discipline,
as well as an appreciation for its beauty and depth.</p>
<p>Our teachers endeavour to introduce mathematical concepts in a creative
manner. The programme empowers students with problem-solving skills, and
stimulates their interest and passion for the subject through an inquiry
approach and applications of Mathematical concepts in real-world contexts.
Students will also develop an understanding of the history and logic behind
the Mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>Students who demonstrate exceptional mathematical ability and have a strong
interest in Mathematics will be given the opportunity to further develop
their potential through Mathematics Olympiads, Local or International Mathematics
Competitions and Research Projects.</p>
