# **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

### Philosophy of PAL

Our children should grow up to be confident persons, adept at working in teams and be able to communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively. They should be self-directed learners who view education as a life-long process. They should also be innovative and enterprising individuals, able to cope with ambiguity and adapt well to change. At the same time, Singapore needs citizens who are morally upright, have a strong sense of civic responsibility and who will contribute actively to society.
