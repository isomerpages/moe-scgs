![](/images/0042%20(1).jpg)


### Philosophy:

SCGS believes in helping our students develop healthy habits for life. We recognise the value of Physical Education in a well-rounded education â€“ we aim to impart knowledge on health and fitness, and to develop mental acuity through a better appreciation and understanding of games. Our Physical Education Programme is also focused on developing teamwork amongst the students.

### Programme:

We advocate a holistic and inter-disciplinary approach to learning. This is achieved through our broad-based P.E. curriculum which caters to students of different abilities and interests. Our lessons educate the students on healthy living and sports and expose them to a wide selection of fundamental movement, modified games, as well as ballet, Chinese dance and Jazz.

Cultivating a strong sense of camaraderie has always been the focus of Physical Education in SCGS. Inter-class games and friendly competitions serve to foster strong bonds among the students. Through P.E. at SCGS, students are not only developed physically but also learn to lead and support the people around them.
