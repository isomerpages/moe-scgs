# **Social Studies**

### Philosophy:

SCGS aims to help students develop sensitivity to the society and the world around them. We would like them to have empathy towards others, and to contribute responsibly and sensibly to our multi-cultural and multi-religious society. We believe in helping them learn to understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the globalised world, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Through our Social Studies Programme, we hope to prepare the students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens with a global outlook yet rooted to Singapore.

### Programme:

The Social Studies Syllabus is organised into three broad clusters: _Discovering Self and Immediate Environment_, _Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present_, and _Appreciating Singapore Region and the World We Live In_. The students will explore who they are in relation to the people and places around them, develop an appreciation for Singapore as they learn about the contributions of different groups of people to the growth of the country, and learn about the world and the various communities of people. These will serve to build their confidence in Singapore’s future and equip them with the knowledge and perspectives to actively participate in shaping Singapore’s destiny in the 21st century.

The curriculum provides a framework within which students can develop critical thinking and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills. The inquiry process gives them the opportunity to be responsible for their own learning through exploration and self-discovery. They will use textbooks, tactile objects and media resources to conduct independent research, evaluate information and draw conclusions.
