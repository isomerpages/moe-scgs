## Art

#### Philosophy:

SCGS believes in cultivating an appreciation for aesthetics through our art programme. We aim to promote creativity, sensory perception and imagination through our broad-based art education that caters to students of different abilities and interests.

#### Programme:

Our programme is designed to equip girls with the ability to create art forms using a variety of mediums such as ceramics, painting and 3D construction, and to help them gain a better understanding of the role of art in our society. Through the creation of visual art, we want to develop their ability to express themselves freely and creatively.

Traditional art features as an important component of our art programme, with cultural art modules such as Chinese Calligraphy and Chinese Brush Painting introducing aspects of local heritage to the girls. Traditional techniques in art are complemented by digital media in our Art Programme.

## Music

#### Philosophy:

The SCGS Music Programme seeks to nurture a lifelong appreciation for the arts. We want to develop studentsâ€™ listening skills and understanding of music through exposure to a wide range of genres. It is our aim to create in our girls an enthusiasm for the aesthetics through the study of music.

#### Programme:

Music lessons at SCGS harmonise the study of music theory, musical instruments and vocal training. Girls will learn to sing, play the recorder, ukelele and non-pitch percussion instruments such as handchimes, and respond to rhythm patterns. Through Digital Music modules, they will have the opportunity to create their own music.

We believe that music is not an aesthetic subject on its own, but a dynamic discipline that can be fused with language and visual art. An interdisciplinary approach is taken in the teaching of music. Girls will embark on music projects that require them to synthesize their knowledge and skills from different disciplines such as language or visual art.
