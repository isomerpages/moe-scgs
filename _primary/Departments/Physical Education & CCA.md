### Philosophy:

SCGS believes in helping our students develop healthy habits for life. We recognise the value of Physical Education in a well-rounded education â€“ we aim to impart knowledge on health and fitness, and to develop mental acuity through a better appreciation and understanding of games. Our Physical Education Programme is also focused on developing teamwork amongst the students.

### Programme:

We advocate a holistic and inter-disciplinary approach to learning. This is achieved through our broad-based P.E. curriculum which caters to students of different abilities and interests. Our lessons educate the students on healthy living and sports and expose them to a wide selection of fundamental movement, modified games, as well as ballet, Chinese dance and Jazz.

Cultivating a strong sense of camaraderie has always been the focus of Physical Education in SCGS. Inter-class games and friendly competitions serve to foster strong bonds among the students. Through P.E. at SCGS, students are not only developed physically but also learn to lead and support the people around them.

### Co-Curricular Activities

Co-curricular programmes take on a distinctive approach in developing every student to be a woman of character and relevance through a range of co-curricular activities as well as enrichment programmes.

Our CCA Department aspires to allow each student to explore and be developed in her area of interest. The school offers a wide range of activities to cater to diverse abilities. It also offers students opportunities to specialise in areas they have chosen.

Through CCA, students develop values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. The participation in CCA will equip them with the relevant knowledge, skills and values that will help them lead balanced lives right into adulthood. The intrinsic values include the cultivation of sound morals, strength of character, healthy habits, team spirit and an aesthetic appreciation of the world around them.

Through Physical Sports, the&nbsp;students develop&nbsp;resilience, fair play and team spirit.

**Clubs and Societies**&nbsp;offer a broad range of activities that expose the student to experiences so as to develop her in the area of interest she has chosen.

**The Performing Arts**&nbsp;instill in the student a sense of graciousness and an appreciation of the rich culture and heritage of a multiracial society.

**The Uniformed Groups**&nbsp;aim to make a good citizen of the student by inculcating in her self-reliance, discipline, resilience and servitude to the community.
