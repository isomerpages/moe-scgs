**ADMISSION TO PRIMARY 1**

Please [click here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration) to refer to Ministry of Education website for information on Primary One Registration Exercise.

**WAITLIST APPLICATION**

The School may at times have a small number of vacancies arising due to students transferring to other schools or going abroad. Applicants who wish to be placed on the school’s waitlist for admission in 2026 would need to submit an online waitlist application form by clicking [here](https://form.gov.sg/68a3ee20cebc3ab977b6b689).

*Note: The school will contact you if a vacancy becomes available for your child. If you do not hear from us by June 2026, it means that there was no available vacancy for your child’s admission in 2026. You will need to submit a new waitlist application from Oct 2026 to be considered for admission to SCGS in 2027.*
