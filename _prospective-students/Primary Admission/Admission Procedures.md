**WAITLIST APPLICATION**

The School may at times have a small number of vacancies arising due to students transferring to other schools or going abroad. Applicants who wish to be placed on the school’s waitlist for admission in 2024 would need to submit an online waitlist application form which would be made available by mid Oct 2023.

*Note: The waitlist application window for admission in 2023 is closed. If your waitlist application for admission into SCGS in 2023 is unsuccessful, you would need to submit a fresh waitlist application from Oct 2023 to 31 May 2024 to be considered for admission into SCGS in 2024.*
