# **Admission Procedures**

**ADMISSION TO PRIMARY 1**

Please [click here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration) to refer to Ministry of Education website for information on Primary One Registration Exercise.

**WAITLIST APPLICATION**

The School may at times have a small number of vacancies arising due to students transferring to other schools or going abroad. Applicants who wish to be placed on the school’s waitlist for admission in 2023 would need to submit an [online waitlist application form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/632bae0bfa18990012033943). The waitlist application window will close on 31 May 2023. If a vacancy arises, shortlisted applicants for the level will be invited for an interview.

*Note: The waitlist application is not on a first come, first served basis and a fresh application is required annually to remain on the waitlist. For instance, if your waitlist application for admission into SCGS in 2022 is unsuccessful, you would need to submit a fresh waitlist application from Oct 2022 to 31 May 2023 to be considered for admission into SCGS in 2023.*
