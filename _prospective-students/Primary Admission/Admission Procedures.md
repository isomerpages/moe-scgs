**WAITLIST APPLICATION**

The School may at times have a small number of vacancies arising due to students transferring to other schools or going abroad. Applicants who wish to be placed on the school’s waitlist for admission in 2025 would need to submit an online waitlist application form by clicking [here](https://form.gov.sg/66d6733f165cea42d4661982).

*Note: The school will contact you if a vacancy becomes available for your child. If you do not hear from us by Jun 2025, it means that there is no available vacancy for your child’s admission in 2025. You will need to submit a new waitlist application in Oct 2025 to be considered for admission to SCGS in 2026..*
