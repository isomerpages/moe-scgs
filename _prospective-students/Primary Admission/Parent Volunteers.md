**Phase 2B Eligibility &amp; Balloting**

Parent Volunteers (PV) are eligible to register their children under Phase 2B of the P1 Registration Exercise.

From the 2012 P1 Registration Exercise onwards, when balloting is necessary in a specific phase, Singapore Citizens (SCs) will be given absolute priority over Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs). SCs and SPRs will continue to be eligible for the same phases, and all applicants will be admitted if the total number of applications in any phase does not exceed the number of vacancies. However, if the number of applications exceeds the number of vacancies in a specific phase, SCs will be admitted first ahead of SPRs, before home-school distance is considered.&nbsp;Should the number of SC applications exceed the number of vacancies in a specific phase, places will be balloted according to the home-school distance categories in the following order of priority.

(a) Children living within 1 km of the school of choice  
(b) Children living between 1 km and 2 km of the school of choice  
(c) Children living outside 2 km of the school of choice

Should the number of SC applications be less than the number of vacancies in a specific phase, all SCs will be admitted first. The remaining vacancies in that phase will be balloted amongst the SPRs based on the above home-school distance categories.
