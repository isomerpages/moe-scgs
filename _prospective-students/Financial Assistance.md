# **Financial Assistance**

The Ministry of Education provides financial assistance to needy Singapore Citizen students in Government or Government-aided schools so that all Singaporeans, regardless of their financial background, can benefit from the best opportunities in education.

**MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (MOE FAS)**

**Primary Division**

Singapore Citizens in Government or Government-aided schools can apply for assistance under MOE FAS.

**Income Limits**

A student is eligible for MOE FAS if he or she meets either of the following criteria:

Gross Household Income (GHI) not exceeding $2,750 per month.

OR

Per Capita Income (PCI)  not exceeding $690 per month

The introduction of PCI will enable students from larger families to benefit from financial assistance. PCI is computed by dividing the gross household income by the number of members in the household.
