**DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION EXERCISE 2022**

(For Admission into Secondary 1 in the year 2023)

 **A. INTRODUCTION**

The Direct School Admission Exercise allows students to seek admission into schools based on achievements and talents. SCGS seeks to admit such students based on a wide range of talents.  
Competition is strong and students entering through DSA are expected to be proactive and sustain their interest to develop their talents through the opportunities offered. There is no priority through affiliation and all students seeking admission will be selected based on their achievements and talents in comparison to all applicants in the same category.  
**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ general academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**
