# **Donations**

Throughout its distinguished 122-year history, SCGS has pursued a vision of developing capable women of character and relevance who are assets to the community. The commitment towards delivering a holistic education that provides the perfect balance of academic excellence across a broad scope of disciplines coupled with character and leadership excellence, has been rigorously sustained by:

* a high-performing and professional team dedicated to both teaching and research in curriculum innovation;
* a talented and diverse body of students prepared to lead and to serve;
* an academic and learning environment that encourages vibrant interaction among members of the SCGS community and
* the essential generosity of alumni, parents and friends.

_**Why Do We Need To Raise Funds?**_

At a time when new technologies and ideas are creating unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges, SCGS aspires to continue extending its leadership in offering a 10-year all girls’ education that will better serve our increasingly global society and community.

The school will focus on strategic areas where significant investment will advance this objective. The upgrading of facilities, development of an expanding curriculum driven by talented, experienced and committed staff, and the funding of scholarships, bursaries and awards, are some of the costs involved. Hence, every gift is appreciated.
