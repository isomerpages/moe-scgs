# **2023 GCE O Level Examination Results**

1\. Our heartiest congratulations to the 2023 Secondary 4 cohort for their excellent performance in the GCE ‘O’ Level examinations! 

2\. The Class of 2023 exemplified adaptability and resilience in the face of an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, which first struck early in their secondary education four years ago.  Together with their teachers, this cohort of Kim Geks adapted quickly to new ways of learning as well as connecting and collaborating with one another through online modes.  They exercised independence and perseverance to continue their journey of growth with positivity amidst changes due to safe management measures.  In the process, they also showed care and kindness to one another.  Over the years, the cohort seized opportunities to enjoy school life fully through experiences such as Sports Festival, SC Rave and self-initiated interclass games facilitated by student leaders.  With their resolute and courageous spirit, we believe the class of 2023 will be in good stead as they move on to the next phase of their educational journey. 

3\. We would like to express our special appreciation to everyone who has guided our Kim Geks. Our team of dedicated and committed teaching and non-teaching staff have guided and supported them with much care and love.  We also deeply appreciate the unwavering partnership of our parents, Board of Directors and Alumni in supporting and nurturing them throughout this milestone journey.
