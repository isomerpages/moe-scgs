### **Sec 1 Posting Day 2022**

21 December 2022

**Principal’s Welcome**

Dear Parents/Guardians

Welcome to SCGS!

Thank you for choosing us as your partner in developing your daughter/ward over the next four years!  We have a long history, a rich heritage, a tradition of excellence in all-round student development. We are committed to giving our _kim geks_ a quality values-based holistic education. We are delighted for the opportunity to help your daughter/ward acquire new skills and knowledge, make new friends and develop her talents. Opportunities will be provided for her to be groomed into a world-ready and principled leader of character and relevance.   

Secondary 1 Reporting Day will be conducted online. You will receive a message via Parents Gateway (PG) by 2pm on 22 December 2022. The message will include a unique link to our online reporting form which you need to complete by 4pm on 23 December to confirm your acceptance of the place at SCGS. Links to other time-sensitive forms will also be included. General information can be downloaded from the school website. 

The first day of school will be on Tue 3 January 2023. We start at 7:40am, so please report to school by 7.20am and make your way to the main lobby. Our prefects and peer leaders will guide the students to their assembly venue.

We have a 4-day Orientation Programme planned for your daughter/ward. The details will be sent to you via PG by 31 December 2022. This same PG message will contain further information on your daughter’s//ward’s temporary class and orientation group as well as fee matters.

Do familiarise your daughter/ward with the public transport route between school and home. The school is conveniently located along the Downtown Line and Thomson-East Coast Line, and is easily accessible by buses plying Whitley Road and Dunearn Road. 

Once again, thank you for choosing SCGS. We look forward to partnering you on your daughter’s / ward’s secondary education, and welcoming her to school. We hope to meet you at the first Parents’ Briefing on Fri 6 January at 5pm, before the Orientation Concert.  

It leaves me to wish you Season’s Greetings and a Happy 2023! 

Yours sincerely

Linda Chan (Mrs)

Principal
